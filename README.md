# Guess The Elo
A Python-based guessing game for Competitive Australian Smash Bros Games

This will find a random player from the [ausmash database](https://ausmash.com.au/), open a random video with one of their sets, and give you 5 attempts to guess their elo based entirely on their gameplay.

This repo shouldn't need any prerequisites to modify the source, but to be honest this isn't really worth looking at if you're any kind of developer, since it's a super simple use of the ausmash api.

# How do I play?
Downloads can be found on the releases page to the right, just download GuessTheElo.exe and run that.
